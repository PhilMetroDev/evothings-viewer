## Evothings Studio App

### Introduction

This is the companion app to [Evothings Studio 2.0](https://github.com/evothings/evothings-studio/tree/evothings2) (note that the code for Evothings Studio 2.0 is in branch "evothings2").

The app consists of a Cordova WebView, a bunch of useful plugins, and a UI to connect to Evothings Studio Workbench.

### Building the App

Run the Ruby script 'build.rb'. It generates files, initializes the Cordova project, fetches plugins, builds the app, and, optionally, installs it on a connected device.
